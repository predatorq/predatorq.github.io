I am currently pursuing a Master of Science Degree in Intelligent Information Systems at the Language Technology Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Before embarking on this journey, I received a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University.

I am actively seeking an internship opportunity for the summer of 2024 for Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) or Software Development Engineering (SDE). Currently, I am engaged in research centered around large language models. During my undergraduate program, my focus was related to Constituency Parsing and Text-to-SQL.
